This project presents a medical health analysis dashboard created using Power BI. It focuses on transforming raw patient data into meaningful visual insights that support healthcare decision-making. The dashboard allows users to interactively explore trends in patient admissions, treatment outcomes, and disease prevalence. Key metrics such as recovery rates, department performance, and demographic breakdowns are visualized using charts, KPIs, and slicers. The data, sourced from anonymized patient records, includes fields like age, gender, diagnosis, and admission details. With features like dynamic filtering and cross-report analysis, the dashboard helps identify patterns, seasonal trends, and performance gaps within a clinical environment. This project demonstrates how data visualization in Power BI can enhance understanding and improve efficiency in the healthcare sector.
